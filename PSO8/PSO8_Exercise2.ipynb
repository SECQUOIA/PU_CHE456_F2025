    "## 🎯 Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we apply the Process Reaction Curve method to approximate the dynamics of a third-order system using an FOPTD model. We then use the **Ziegler-Nichols** tuning rules to calculate the PID controller parameters, and simulate the closed-loop performance. The goal is to compare the controller performance using the **FOPTD** approximation and the **system's actual response**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💻 Code Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Defines the original system and its corresponding FOPTD model and compares the two.\n",
    "2. Calculates the PID controller parameters using the Ziegler-Nichols tuning rules.\n",
    "3. Simulates the closed-loop performance using the calculated PID parameters and compares the results with the system's response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔑 Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Padé Approximation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Padé approximation** is a method used to approximate time delays in transfer functions. It is especially useful when dealing with systems that involve time delays, which are often hard to model directly. In this exercise, we use the **Padé approximation** to represent the time delay in the FOPTD model. The transfer function for the **Padé approximation** of a time delay $\\theta$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e^{-\\theta s} \\approx \\frac{1 - \\frac{\\theta s}{2}}{1 + \\frac{\\theta s}{2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approximation converts the delay term into a rational transfer function, making it easier to analyze and simulate in control systems. In the code, we use this approximation to model the time delay component of the system in the **FOPTD model**."

    "## ✅ Conclusions: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we analyzed two key aspects of controller performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PID Response Comparison**:  \n",
    "  - The PID controller tuned using the FOPTD (First Order Plus Dead Time) model produced a faster and less oscillatory response compared to the PID controller tuned in Exercise 1.\n",
    "  - Although both controllers ultimately stabilized around the setpoint, the FOPTD-based tuning achieved better transient behavior, with reduced overshoot and faster settling time.\n",
    "  - This demonstrates the effectiveness of tuning based on a simplified dynamic model when properly identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System vs FOPTD Model Approximation**:  \n",
    "  - Comparing the original third-order system with its FOPTD approximation showed good agreement, especially during the early and mid-term response phases.\n",
    "  - The FOPTD model slightly underestimates the system response at steady-state but captures the dominant dynamics effectively.\n",
    "  - This validates the use of simple approximations like FOPTD for PID tuning, offering a balance between model simplicity and control performance.\n",
    "  - **FOPTD approximations** are reliable for designing controllers when full system dynamics are complex or unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise highlights how **model-based tuning strategies** can enhance controller performance even when working with approximated system representations.\n",
