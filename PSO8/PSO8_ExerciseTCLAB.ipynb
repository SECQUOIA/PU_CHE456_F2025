    "## ✅ Conclusion: \n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise demonstrates how different control strategies (P-only, PI, and PID) affect both the **system response** and the **control effort**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P-only Controller**:  \n",
    "  - Achieves a moderate rise in temperature but exhibits a steady-state error (offset) relative to the setpoint.\n",
    "  - The control effort (Q1) stabilizes at a lower level but is insufficient to fully eliminate the steady-state error.\n",
    "  - System shows smooth behavior but limited final accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PI Controller**:  \n",
    "  - Improves the steady-state performance by eliminating the offset, thanks to the integral action.\n",
    "  - However, the system response is slower compared to the P-only controller.\n",
    "  - The control effort remains relatively smooth but at a slightly higher level to sustain convergence toward the setpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PID Controller**:  \n",
    "  - Provides the fastest convergence to the setpoint with minimal steady-state error.\n",
    "  - Introduces higher variability (oscillations) in the control effort (Q1), indicating more aggressive corrective actions.\n",
    "  - Despite control effort fluctuations, the system output (T1) is well regulated and reaches the target temperature quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔎 Summary:\n",
    "- **P-only**: Quick but inaccurate (steady-state error remains).\n",
    "- **PI**: Eliminates steady-state error but results in a slower response.\n",
    "- **PID**: Best accuracy and speed, but introduces control signal oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison highlights the classical trade-offs in control system design:  \n",
    "faster response and improved accuracy often come at the expense of greater control effort variability.\n",
